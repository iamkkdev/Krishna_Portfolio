# [Project 1: Classifying real and fake tweets: Project Overview](https://github.com/iamkkdev/Thinkful-github/blob/master/Final%20Capstone.ipynb)
•	Predicting fake tweets with Kaggle test dataset using various techniques like Bag of words, TF-IDF, word2vec.

•	Classification techniques used: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier

•	Lemmatizer, regular expressions

•	Used wordcloud to visualize frequent words

# [Project 2: Experimental Design](https://github.com/iamkkdev/Thinkful-github/blob/master/AB%20Final.ipynb)
•	Experimental Design using data related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.

•	Performed AB testing on single and married groups

•	Determined which group has higher subscription rate and what can we do to improve the subscription rates

•	Used t-tests, pointplots, histograms, barplots, heatmaps etc..

# [Project 3: Predicted the status of startup companies based on various investment factors](https://github.com/iamkkdev/Thinkful-github/blob/master/SUPERVISED%20CAPSTONE.ipynb)
•	Used Supervised Learning methods to predict the status of startups based on investment factors

•	Predicted which features played important role in predicting the status of a start up

•	Dealt with sparse data

•	Used oversampling and undersampling techniques to deal with imbalanced data
